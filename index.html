        <h2>Bio</h2>
        <p>Astarte (2002, Brooklyn, New York) is a versatile artist exploring the realms of writing, 
            design, and film. Her work consists of vibrant diverse, pieces designed to deeply resonate 
            with individuals through relatable, uplifting, and thought-provoking narratives. 
            <br>
            <br>
            Primarily a writer and filmmaker, Astarte crafts pieces that invites users on a journey of self-reflection
            and exploration. Whether weaving intricate worlds in fiction or constructing websites, she infuses 
            a playful, colorful, and spontaneous spirit into her projects.
            <br>
            <br>
            Astarte's design approach is characterized by a commitment to breaking conventional norms. From 
            HTML websites to short films experimenting with various colors to convey emotions, she explores 
            the boundaries of artistic expression. In her written work, such as "The Boom Bus," she challenges 
            traditional storytelling structures like The Hero’s Journey, embracing a mindset of what she likes 
            to call "writing outside of the box."

            <br>

            Her inspiration emanates from a profound desire to enlighten audiences and provide a cheerful experience 
            through her art. As she articulates, being an artist allows her to connect with people 
            on a level that exceeds the ordinary, resonating with those who share her visionary perspective.
            Beyond her creative writing and design pursuits, Astarte engages in exploratory studies that push 
            the boundaries of visual representation. For instance, she conducted a study analyzing her 
            personal Instagram data, transforming it into an interactive game. Users play as the social
             media app, wandering through a neighborhood to hunt for her data. Astarte manipulated the 
             size of each asset Instagram claimed she had an interest in and altered its size in terms 
             of accuracy. Challenging the precision of data representation and experimenting with innovative 
             methods that one can utilize to visually display data.
             <br>
             <br>
             In her latest project, AI OR US, Astarte delves into the intersection of artificial intelligence 
             and filmmaking by designing a series of short films, where one character’s script is entirely 
             AI-generated, while the rest are written by Astarte herself. The challenge for viewers is to identify 
             which script was created by the AI, with each film becoming progressively harder to discern. 
             The first few films are animated, but Astarte's upcoming live-action film, set to be released 
             in the spring, represents the most complex version yet. With each new iteration, the task of 
             detecting AI involvement grows more difficult, raising the overarching question: How human can I 
             become?

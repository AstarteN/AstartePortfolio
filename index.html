            <h2>Bio</h2>
            <p>Astarte (2002, Brooklyn, New York) is a versatile artist exploring the realms of writing, 
                design, and film. Her work consists of vibrant diverse, pieces designed to deeply resonate 
                with individuals through relatable, uplifting, and thought-provoking narratives. 
                <br><br>
                Primarily a writer and filmmaker, Astarte crafts pieces that invites users on a journey of self-reflection
                and exploration. Whether weaving intricate worlds in fiction or constructing websites, she infuses 
                a playful, colorful, and spontaneous spirit into her projects.
                <br><br>
                Astarte's design approach is characterized by a commitment to breaking conventional norms. From 
                HTML websites to short films experimenting with various colors to convey emotions, she explores 
                the boundaries of artistic expression. In her written work, she challenges 
                traditional storytelling structures like The Hero’s Journey, embracing a mindset of what she likes 
                to call "writing outside of the box."
                <br><br>
                Her inspiration emanates from a profound desire to enlighten audiences and provide a cheerful experience 
                through her art. As she articulates, being an artist allows her to connect with people 
                on a level that exceeds the ordinary, resonating with those who share her visionary perspective.
                Beyond her creative writing and design pursuits, Astarte engages in exploratory studies that push 
                the boundaries of visual representation. For instance, she conducted a study analyzing her 
                personal Instagram data, transforming it into an interactive game. Users play as the social
                 media app, wandering through a neighborhood to hunt for her data. Astarte manipulated the 
                 size of each asset Instagram claimed she had an interest in and altered its size in terms 
                 of accuracy. Challenging the precision of data representation and experimenting with innovative 
                 methods that one can utilize to visually display data.
                 <br><br>
                 In her latest project, AI OR US, Astarte delves into the intersection of artificial intelligence 
                 and filmmaking by designing a series of short films, where one character’s script is entirely 
                 AI-generated, while the rest are written by Astarte herself. The challenge for viewers is to identify 
                 which script was created by the AI, with each film becoming progressively harder to discern. 
                 The first few films are animated, but Astarte's upcoming live-action film, set to be released 
                 in the spring, represents the most complex version yet. With each new iteration, the task of 
                 detecting AI involvement grows more difficult, raising the overarching question: How human can AI 
                 become?
